# Circle-perimeter-and-area-calculator
Circle perimeter and area calculator

input:

first line, a variable n(n>0), represents several sets of data

c++:

next n line(or lines), input a variable a and a variable m.

a means different species:

when you input a, the variable m will be the radius of a circle. And then, it will calculate the perimeter.

when you input b, the variable m will be the diameter of a circle. And then, it will calculate the perimeter.

when you input c, the variable m will be the radius of a circle. And then, it will calculate the area.

when you input d, the variable m will be the diameter of a circle. And then, it will calculate the area.

python:

next 2n lines, input a variable a on the first line and a variable m on the second line.

a means different species:

when you input a, the variable m will be the radius of a circle. And then, it will calculate the perimeter.

when you input b, the variable m will be the diameter of a circle. And then, it will calculate the perimeter.

when you input c, the variable m will be the radius of a circle. And then, it will calculate the area.

when you input d, the variable m will be the diameter of a circle. And then, it will calculate the area.

output:

n line(or lines), the operation results.
